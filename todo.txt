The segments need a special options flag enabled at connection start:

[gpadmin@aad2e945090e ~]$ psql -p 7000 -d gpadmin
psql: FATAL:  connections to primary segments are not allowed
DETAIL:  This database instance is running as a primary segment in a Greenplum cluster and does not permit direct connections.
HINT:  To force a connection anyway (dangerous!), use utility mode.


[gpadmin@aad2e945090e ~]$ PGOPTIONS='-c gp_session_role=utility' psql -p 7000 -d gpadmin
psql (9.4.26)
Type "help" for help.
